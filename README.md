# IVR-BTMS
Battery Thermal Management System using MATLAB/Simulink
This project is about simulating a Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) for lithium-ion battery pack using MATLAB Simulink. The model mainly uses a cooling plate with ON/OFF logic to manage battery temperature during operation. We used different modeling approaches and Simulink files to implement and test the system.

Tools Used

MATLAB
Simscape
Simulink
Files and Descriptions
1. batterypack_coolingplate.slx
This is the main Simulink model we used to simulate the cooling plate-based BTMS. The battery pack used in this model was imported from a myBatteryPack.slx file that we had created using the Simscape Battery Builder. The battery was connected to a thermal system with a cooling plate, thermal reservoir, and ON/OFF switching logic based on temperature. This file shows how the basic BTMS system works using logic blocks and thermal components.you have to first loadmyBatteryPack.mat and myBatteryPack_lib.slx before using model.

2. NBatteries.slx
This file contains a battery pack that we created completely using MathWorks' Battery Builder tool. It models a full 1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack with the following configuration:

10 cylindrical cells in parallel
2 parallel assemblies in series = 1 module
2 modules in series = 1 module assembly
5 module assemblies in series = 1 battery pack
This structure was modeled directly using simscape.battery.builder. The geometry used for each cell was cylindrical. This file was used as the base for our fan/radiator cooling model.

3. ncoolingfan.slx
In this file, we attempted to create a more advanced BTMS using a fan and radiator system. We used fan blocks and heat exchanger components from Simulink to cool the battery pack created in NBatteries.slx. However, this model did not simulate successfully due to issues with unit mismatches (like m³/s vs. kg/s) and physical port connection errors. Although it didn’t run, it showed us how complex active cooling models can be and helped us identify areas that need debugging.

💡 Summary
We used Battery Builder to build realistic battery packs in different configurations.
Multiple Simulink models were created to test various cooling methods (cooling plate, fan, heat exchanger).
Our main working model is batterypack_coolingplate.slx which uses a basic ON/OFF control method.
Other models were helpful in experimenting and learning, even though not all of them ran successfully.
This work helped us get a better understanding of Simscape Battery modeling and different BTMS architectures using MATLAB.
